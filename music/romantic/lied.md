## Strophic, Durchkomponiert (Through-composed), and Modified Strophic Forms

These three forms were the most common forms for a Lied, but the form isn't restricted to just them.

- Strophic
  - **Same melody for each verse/stanza.**
  - Easy to remember.
  - Used in most folk songs.
- Durchkomponiert
  - **Melody changes for each verse/stanza to match the mood.**
  - More exciting but harder to remember.
- Modified Strophic
  - **ABAB... or a rudimentary theme-and-variations.**
  - Frequently used for poems with 3 stanzas.

## Song Cycles

- Lieder are often grouped together in a **song cycle**.
- Musical ideas or a single story link them together.
