# *Erlkönig* - Schubert

[Back to the Romantic period](/music/romantic)

Schubert composed over 600 Lieder. *Erlkönig* was one of his great works and he composed it when he was 18 years old. This Lied is set to the poem/ballad by Goethe with the same title.

Goethe's ballad tells of a father riding on horseback through a storm with his sick child in his arms. The delirious boy sees visions of the Erlkönig, the king of elves and a symbol of death. The Erlkönig repeatedly tries to coax the boy to come to him and ultimately takes the boy (i.e. kills him) by force.

## Elements of Music

### Rhythm

- The repeated triplet rhythm in the bass of the accompaniment suggests the horse's gallop.

### Harmony

- The primary key is G minor, which is quite dark and shows uneasiness.
- In the sections where the Erlkönig speaks, the key changes to a major key, which shows that he is trying to entice the boy.
- G minor (bar 1) - B flat major (bar 58) - B minor (bar 72) - C major (bar 87) - C sharp minor (bar 97) - D minor (bar 112) - E flat major (bar 117)

### Melody

- The narrator sings in the voice's middle range.
- The father sings in the voice's lowest range.
- The boy and the Erlkönig both sing in the voice's highest range.
- To show rising tension and terror, the boy's melodies rise chromatically.
- Whenever the Erlkönig sings, the horse's gallop disappears. This shows that everything is happening in the boy's head.

### Timbre

- Like all Lieder, we have a solo voice with piano accompaniment.
- The voice is baritone, so both the low voice of the father and the high voices of the boy and the Erlkönig are heard.

### Form

- This Lied is durchkomponiert, since the melody changes for each verse/stanza.
- The short introduction introduces the horse - the only non-speaking character.

### Texture

- When the father and the son speak, the texture is very thick and homophonic. This creates a sense of horror and panic.
- When the Erlkönig speaks, the texture becomes thinner and more jolly. This makes sense, since the Erlkönig is trying to coax the boy and he's speaking inside the boy's mind (instead of in real life).

## Abridged Lyrics

**Narrator:** Daddy 'n son ridin' late in the night. What they gonna do?

**Father:** Yo son why you so scared?

**Son:** Can't you see the Erlkönig with his crown and train?

**Father:** Boi you trippin'. That's just mist.

**Erlkönig:** Come home with me, kiddo! I'll play games with you and give you colourful flowers and golden clothes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

**Son:** Dad are you deaf or something? That's clearly the Erlkönig promising me cool stuff.

**Father:** Shut yo face boi. It's just the wind in the dead leaves.

**Erlkönig:** Come with me, pretty boy. My daughters will serve and dance with you every night ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

**Son:** Wow dad you're as blind as a bat. Don't you see Erlkönig's daughters in the shadows?

**Father:** The only thing I see is you shuttin' the fuck up. You're just looking at the willows.

**Erlkönig:** If you're gonna be a lil' bitch and not come with me, I'll just take you by force ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

**Son:** Dad he's touching me!

**Narrator:** Oof boy dead now :(
