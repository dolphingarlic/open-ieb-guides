# *Erlkönig* - Schubert

[Back to the Romantic period](/music/romantic)

Schubert composed over 600 Lieder. *Erlkönig* was one of his great works and he composed it when he was 18 years old. This Lied is set to the poem/ballad by Goethe with the same title.

Goethe's ballad tells of a father riding on horseback through a storm with his sick child in his arms. The delirious boy sees visions of the Erlkönig, the king of elves and a symbol of death. The Erlkönig repeatedly tries to coax the boy to come to him and ultimately takes the boy (i.e. kills him) by force.

## Elements of Music

### Rhythm

- The repeated triplet rhythm in the bass of the accompaniment suggests the horse's gallop.

### Harmony

- The primary key is G minor, which is quite dark and shows uneasiness.
- In the sections where the Erlkönig speaks, the key changes to a major key, which shows that he is trying to entice the boy.

### Melody

### Timbre

- Like all Lieder, we have a solo voice with piano accompaniment.
- The voice is baritone, so both the low voice of the father and the high voices of the boy and the Erlkönig are heard.

### Form

- This Lied is durchkomponiert, since the melody changes for each verse/stanza.

### Texture

## Abridged Lyrics

**Narrator:** Daddy 'n son ridin' late in the night. What they gonna do?

**Father:** Yo son why you so scared?

**Son:** Can't you see the Erlkönig with his crown and train?

**Father:** Boi you trippin'. That's just mist.

**Erlkönig:** Come home with me, kiddo! I'll play games with you and give you colourful flowers and golden clothes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

**Son:** Dad are you deaf or something? That's clearly the Erlkönig promising me cool stuff.

**Father:** Shut yo face boi. It's just the wind in the dead leaves.

**Erlkönig:** Come with me, pretty boy. My daughters will serve you and dance with you every night ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

**Son:** Wow dad you're as blind as a bat. Don't you see Erlkönig's daughters in the shadows?

**Father:** The only thing I see is you shuttin' the fuck up. You're just looking at the willows.

**Erlkönig:** Well if you're gonna be a lil' bitch and not come with me, I'll just take you by force ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

**Son:** Dad he's touching me!

**Narrator:** Oof boy dead now :(
