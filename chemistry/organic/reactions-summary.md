# Organic Chemistry Reactions - Summary

[Back to organic chemistry](/chemistry/organic)

## Combustion (Oxidation) Reactions

- Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and alcohols to water and carbon dioxide (complete combustion) or carbon monoxide and carbon (incomplete combustion).
- Exothermic.
- Condition:
  - Oxygen present.
- Complete combustion equation:
  - $\ce{C5H10 + 7O2 -> 5CO2 + 5H2O}$
- Incomplete combustion equations:
  - $\ce{C5H10 + 5O2 -> 5CO + 5H2O}$
  - $\ce{2C5H10 + 5O2 -> 10C + 10H2O}$

## Substitution Reactions

Substitution reactions involve the **substitution** of molecular fragments.

Substitution is faster in haloalkanes than in alkanes because the carbon-halogen bond is polar.

### Halogenation (Free-radical Halogenation)

- Alkanes to haloalkanes.
- Conditions:
  - UV light or heat.
  - Halogens present (e.g. $\ce{Cl2}$ or $\ce{Br2}$).
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H12 + Cl2 -> C5H11Cl + HCl}$

### Hydrolysis

- Haloalkanes to alcohols.
- Conditions:
  - Heat.
  - Dilute alkali solution (e.g. **aqueous** $\ce{NaOH}$).
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H11Cl + NaOH -> C5H11OH + NaCl}$

## Addition Reactions

Addition reactions involve double bonds opening and molecular fragments being **added** to the alkene and nothing being removed.

These reactions occur quite easily because the double bond is reactive.

For IEB, if 2 addition reactions are possible, either one will be accepted.

### Halogenation (Hydrogen Halide Addition)

- Alkenes to haloalkanes with **2 halogens**.
- Condition:
  - Presence of a halogen (e.g. $\ce{Br2}$).
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H10 + Br2 -> C5H10Br2}$
- **Used as a test for alkenes - turns from brown to colourless quickly (even when done in darkness)**.

### Hydrohalogenation

- Alkenes to haloalkanes with **1 halogen**.
- Conditions:
  - Presence of a hydrogen halide (e.g. $\ce{HBr}$).
  - **No water may be present.**
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H10 + HBr -> C5H11Br}$

### Hydrogenation

- Alkenes to alkanes.
- Conditions:
  - Alkene dissolved in an organic solvent (e.g. ethanol).
  - $\ce{Pt}$, $\ce{Pd}$, or $\ce{Ni}$ catalyst.
  - $\ce{H2}$ atmosphere.
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H10 + H2 -> C5H12}$

### Hydration

- Alkenes to alcohols.
- Conditions:
  - Steam (i.e. boiling $\ce{H2O}$).
  - A suitable catalyst (e.g. $\ce{H3PO4}$).
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H10 + H2O -> C5H11OH}$

## Elimination Reactions

Elimination reactions involve molecular fragments being **removed** from a molecule, leaving a double bond.

For IEB, if 2 elimination reactions are possible, either one will be accepted.

### Dehydrohalogenation

- Haloalkanes to haloalkenes (2 or more halogens) or alkenes (only 1 halogen) and hydrogen halides.
- Conditions:
  - **Hot, concentrated $\ce{NaOH}$ or $\ce{KOH}$ in an ethanol solvent.**
  - **No water present.**
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H11Cl -> C5H10 + HCl}$

### Dehydration

- Alcohols to alkenes and water.
- Conditions:
  - Acid catalyst (e.g. $\ce{H2SO4}$ or $\ce{H3PO4}$).
  - Heat.
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H11OH -> C5H10 + H2O}$

### Cracking

- Alkanes to smaller hydrocarbons, including **at least 1 alkene**.
- Conditions:
  - High temperatures and pressure (Thermal cracking).
  - A catalyst (Catalytic cracking).
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H12 -> C3H6 + C2H6}$

## Esterification

- Carboxylic acids and alcohols to esters and water.
- Conditions:
  - Heat.
  - An acid catalyst (e.g. $\ce{H2SO4}$).
    - $\ce{H2SO4}$ is also **hydroscopic** (i.e. it's a dehydrating agent), which helps here.
- Equation:
  - $\ce{C5H11OOH + C3H7OH -> C5H11OOC3H7 + H2O}$
