[Back to acids and bases](/chemistry/acid-base)

## Acids

- **Acid** - A proton donor.
- **Ionisation** - The reaction of a **molecular substance** with water to produce ions.
- **Strong acid** - An acid that **ionises completely** in an aqueous solution.
- **Weak acid** - An acid that **only ionises partially** in an aqueous solution.
- **Polyprotic acid** - An acid that can donate more than 1 proton.

## Bases

- **Base** - A proton acceptor.
- **Dissociation** - The splitting of an **ionic compound** into its ions.
- **Strong base** - A base that **dissociates completely** in an aqueous solution.
- **Weak base** - A base that **only dissociates partially** in an aqueous solution.

## Conjugate Acid-base Pairs

- **Amphoteric** - Able to act as both an acid and a base.
- **Ampholyte** - An amphoteric substance.
- **Conjugate acid-base pair** - An acid and a base that **differ by exactly 1 proton**.

## pH

- **pH** - The measure of the $\ce{H3O+}$ concentration in a solution.
- **Autoprotolysis** - The **automatic** ionisation and dissociation of water to form $\ce{H3O+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$. (Equation: $\ce{H2O + H2O -> H3O+ + OH-}$)
- **$K_w$** - The equilibrium constant for the autoprotolysis of water.
- **Indicator** - (Usually) a **weak acid** that change colours at specific pH values.

## Salts

- **Salt** - An (ionic) substance where the hydrogen of an acid **has been replaced by a cation**.
- **Hydrolysis of a salt** - The reaction of a salt with water where **water itself is decomposed**.

## Titrations

- **Titration** - The process used to determine the **unknown concentration** of an acid or base.
- **Equivalence/neutralisation point** - The point where amounts of acid and base have been reacted so that **neither is in excess**.
