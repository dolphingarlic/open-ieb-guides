# *Portrait of a Loaf of Bread* - Mbuyiseni Oswald Mtshali (1940-)

[Return to poetry](/english/poetry)

Look back to the rolling fields<br/>
waving gold-topped wheat stalks<br/>
mowed by the reaper's scythe,<br/>
bundled into sheaves<br/>
carted to the mill<br/>
and ground into flour.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneaded into mountains of dough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be churned by rollers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spat into pans as red hot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as Satan's cauldron

Brought to the café,<br/>
warmly wrapped in cellophane,<br/>
by 'Eat Fresh Bread' bakery van;<br/>
for the waiting cook<br/>
to slice and toast<br/>
to butter and to marmalade<br/>
for the food-bedecked breakfast table.

Whilst the labourer<br/>
with fingers caked with<br/>
wet cement of a builder's scaffold<br/>
mauls a hunk and a cold drink<br/>
and licks his lips and laughs<br/>
'Man can live on bread alone.'

## Analysis

### Message and Themes

**TL;DR: Bread fanfiction - although bread is enjoyed by all regardless of background, most take it for granted and few people understand the intricate process behind the making of it.**

#### Stanza 1

The entire first stanza of the poem is about the process behind the making of a loaf of bread, from the "rolling fields" all the way to "Satan's cauldron". It's the longest stanza and uses the most descriptive language (e.g. "rolling fields", "gold-topped wheat stalks", and "mountains of dough").

The length **emphasizes the intricacy and length of the process**, while the descriptive language creates a **romantic (and somewhat immersive) mood**.

The adjectives used to describe the wheat in the first two lines ("rolling", "waving", and "gold-topped") have connotations of grandeur and make the reader picture an endless field of wheat. The next four lines are much more clinical, as there aren't any words that evoke any particular emotion.

The indentation in the last four lines of this stanza could possibly be there to separate the 2 main parts of the process (i.e. making the flour and turning that flour into a loaf of bread). It shows the separation between farmers manually harvesting the wheat and the machines in the factory automatically forming dough and baking the dough.

However, the indentation could also possibly emphasize those lines. This makes sense because the last four lines are the steps in breadmaking the average person is most familiar with.

#### Stanza 2

The second stanza shows the reader how wealthy people enjoy bread.

We know that the people who eat bread in this stanza are wealthy because they are sitting at a "food-bedecked breakfast table" at a café. Butter and maramalade are also associated with wealth, as they are quite expensive.

A lot in this stanza is presented in a delicate way - the bread is "warmly wrapped in cellophane" and a cook carefully prepares the food by "slic[ing] and toast[ing]" the bread.

However, the people eating the bread clearly take it for granted. A "food-bedecked breafast table" implies that there is a surplus of food, so the diners probably wouldn't care much about the bread because they have food already. Even though the cook slices, toasts, butters, and spreads marmalade on the bread, there is no indication that the diners care about any of that effort at all.

#### Stanza 3

This stanza presents us with a contrasting image of a poor labourer enjoying bread.

The labourer lacks the delicacy of the wealthier diners in the second stanza (he "mauls a hunk" of bread whereas the diners eat "slice[s]"), but he eats bread just like they do. This tells us that bread is enjoyed by everyone regardless of economic background.

However, the verb "maul" implies that the labourer tore a chunk of the bread without any care or consideration. This implies that he also doesn't fully appreciate the process behind making the bread. He does remark that "Man can live on bread alone" though, which implies that he somewhat appreciates the process (unlike the diners in the second stanza).

### The Last Line

"Man can live on bread alone" is an interesting parody of the original bible verse "man **cannot** live on bread alone". Mtshali ends the poem with this line, which implies that it is quite important.

The original bible verse meant that bread alone doesn't give man enough purpose. In this poem, we see how intricate the process of breadmaking and how universal bread is, which imply that bread does actually give man enough purpose.

### The Title

A portrait is defined as either (1) a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person; or (2) a representation or impression of someone or something in language or on film.

In this poem, the second definition is far better captured than the first.

Firstly, **we never get a physical representation of the bread in the poem** (e.g. we don't know whether it's sourdough or wholewheat). The closest thing we get is the description of the bread being "warmly wrapped in cellophane".

This lack of physical representation is likely intentional - by not giving us the details, **the message of the poem becomes much more universal** (imagine if the poem was titled *Portrait of a Loaf of **Albany Low GI Sandwich Bread*** instead).

Secondly, **we get a very clear image of what bread is like and how people enjoy it**. We are told the process of breadmaking and we are presented with 2 differing scenarios of people enjoying bread.

Even if we didn't know what bread was, we would be able to describe its purpose after reading this poem.
