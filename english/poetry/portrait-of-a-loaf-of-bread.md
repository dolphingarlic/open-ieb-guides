# *Portrait of a Loaf of Bread* - Mbuyiseni Oswald Mtshali (1940-)

Look back to the rolling fields<br/>
waving gold-topped wheat stalks<br/>
mowed by the reaper's scythe,<br/>
bundled into sheaves<br/>
carted to the mill<br/>
and ground into flour.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneaded into mountains of dough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be churned by rollers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spat into pans as red hot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as Satan's cauldron

Brought to the caf√©,<br/>
warmly wrapped in cellophane,<br/>
by 'Eat Fresh Bread' bakery van;<br/>
for the waiting cook<br/>
to slice and toast<br/>
to butter and to marmalade<br/>
for the food-bedecked breakfast table.

Whilst the labourer<br/>
with fingers caked with<br/>
wet cement of a builder's scaffold<br/>
mauls a hunk and a cold drink<br/>
and licks his lips and laughs<br/>
'Man can live on bread alone.'

## Analysis

### Message and Themes

**TL;DR: Bread fanfiction - although bread is enjoyed by all regardless of background, most take it for granted and few people understand the intricate process behind making it.**

#### Stanza 1

The entire first stanza of the poem is about the process behind the making of a loaf of bread, from the "rolling fields" all the way to "Satan's cauldron". It's the longest stanza and uses the most descriptive language (e.g. "rolling fields", "gold-topped wheat stalks", and "mountains of dough").

The length **emphasizes the intricacy and length of the process**, while the descriptive language creates a **romantic (and somewhat immersive) mood**.

*Stuff*

The indentation in the last four lines of this stanza could possibly be there to separate the 2 main parts of the process (i.e. making the flour and turning that flour into a loaf of bread). It shows the separation between farmers manually harvesting the wheat and the machines in the factory automatically forming dough and baking the dough.

However, the indentation could also possibly emphasize those lines. This makes sense because the last four lines are the steps in breadmaking the average person is most familiar with.

#### Stanza 2

### The Title

A portrait is defined as either (1) a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person; or (2) a representation or impression of someone or something in language or on film.

In this poem, the second definition is far better captured than the first.

Firstly, **we never get a physical representation of the bread in the poem** (e.g. we don't know whether it's sourdough or wholewheat). The closest thing we get is the description of the bread being "warmly wrapped in cellophane".

This lack of physical representation is likely intentional - by not giving us the details, **the message of the poem becomes much more universal** (imagine if the poem was titled *Portrait of a Loaf of **Albany Low GI Sandwich Bread*** instead).

Secondly,

All three of these poems are Apartheid-era poems that comment on inequality in South Africa. Even though the types of inequality (i.e. class, economic, and racial) seem quite different, they are actually very similar and are caused by the same problems.
