# *Portrait of a Loaf of Bread* - Mbuyiseni Oswald Mtshali (1940-)

Look back to the rolling fields<br/>
waving gold-topped wheat stalks<br/>
mowed by the reaper's scythe,<br/>
bundled into sheaves<br/>
carted to the mill<br/>
and ground into flour.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneaded into mountains of dough<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be churned by rollers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spat into pans as red hot<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as Satan's cauldron

Brought to the caf√©,<br/>
warmly wrapped in cellophane,<br/>
by 'Eat Fresh Bread' bakery van;<br/>
for the waiting cook<br/>
to slice and toast<br/>
to butter and to marmalade<br/>
for the food-bedecked breakfast table.

Whilst the labourer<br/>
with fingers caked with<br/>
wet cement of a builder's scaffold<br/>
mauls a hunk and a cold drink<br/>
and licks his lips and laughs<br/>
'Man can live on bread alone.'

Firstly, we never get a physical representation of the bread in the poem (e.g. we don't know whether it's sourdough or wholewheat). The closest thing we get is the description of the bread being "warmly wrapped in cellophane".

This lack of physical representation is likely intentional - by not

Both of these poems are about portraits, be it a literal portrait or just an image of something. Which poem would you say captures the definitions of a portrait better?

### *Lost or Found World* - Mongane Wally Serote (1944-) and *Nightsong: City* - Dennis Brutus (1924-)

All three of these poems are Apartheid-era poems that comment on inequality in South Africa. Even though the types of inequality (i.e. class, economic, and racial) seem quite different, they are actually very similar and are caused by the same problems.
