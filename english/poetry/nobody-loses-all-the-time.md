# *nobody loses all the time* - E. E. Cummings (1894-1962)

i had an uncle named<br/>
Sol who was a born failure and<br/>
nearly everybody said he should have gone<br/>
into vaudeville perhaps because my Uncle Sol could<br/>
sing McCann He Was A Diver on Xmas Eve like Hell Itself which<br/>
may or may not account for the fact that my Uncle

Sol indulged in that possibly most inexcusable<br/>
of all to use a highfalootin phrase<br/>
luxuries that is or to<br/>
wit farming and be<br/>
it needlessly<br/>
added

my Uncle Sol’s farm<br/>
failed because the chickens<br/>
ate the vegetables so<br/>
my Uncle Sol had a<br/>
chicken farm till the<br/>
skunks ate the chickens when

my Uncle Sol<br/>
had a skunk farm but<br/>
the skunks caught cold and<br/>
died so<br/>
my Uncle Sol imitated the<br/>
skunks in a subtle manner

or by drowning himself in the watertank<br/>
but somebody who’d given my Unde Sol a Victor<br/>
Victrola and records while he lived presented to<br/>
him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease a<br/>
scrumptious not to mention splendiferous funeral with<br/>
tall boys in black gloves and flowers and everything and

i remember we all cried like the Missouri<br/>
when my Uncle Sol’s coffin lurched because<br/>
somebody pressed a button<br/>
(and down went<br/>
my Uncle<br/>
Sol

and started a worm farm)

## Poem with Punctuation

Nobody loses all the time. I had an uncle named Sol who was a born failure, and nearly everybody said he should have gone into vaudeville, perhaps because my Uncle Sol could sing 'McCann He Was A Diver on Xmas Eve like Hell Itself', which may or may not account for the fact that my Uncle Sol indulged in that possibly most inexcusable of all (to use a highfalootin phrase) - "luxuries", that is, or to wit farming. And be it needlessly added, my Uncle Sol’s farm failed because the chickens ate the vegetables, so my Uncle Sol had a chicken farm till the skunks ate the chickens when my Uncle Sol had a skunk farm, but the skunks caught cold and died, and so my Uncle Sol imitated the skunks in a subtle manner, or by drowning himself in the watertank.  But somebody who’d given my Uncle Sol a Victor Victrola and records while he lived presented to him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease, a scruptious (not to mention splendiferous) funeral with tall boys in black gloves and flowers and everything, and I remember we all cried like the Missouri when my Uncle Sol’s coffin lurched because somebody pressed a button (and down went my Uncle Sol and started a worm farm.)
