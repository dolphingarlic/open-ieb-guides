# *Lost or Found World* - Mongane Wally Serote (1944-)

Skies of truth are now scenes<br/>
At the mercy of my curtain eyes,<br/>
I wink often more often,<br/>
To draw the curtains<br/>
To cut and forget the skies.

The sea of identity is tears,<br/>
A too salty expression<br/>
Bleeding my blue veins that's my pen,<br/>
On the loose sand that shall sip,<br/>
And the wind shall help cover it,<br/>
From the needy arteries.

Mountains of hope are flowers,<br/>
Passes attracting cars like bees,<br/>
For the precious modern honey,<br/>
That is money.<br/>
Snaps flowers from their stems<br/>
Leaves dry dead bodies, walking up the street.

Old wishes is present deeds,<br/>
Bright with blinding for old<br/>
Dark with wonder for the new,<br/>
That's where we are<br/>
Lost or found world!
