# *Nightsong: City* - Dennis Brutus (1924-)

Sleep well, my love sleep well:<br/>
the harbor light glaze over restless docks,<br/>
police cars cockroach through the tunnel streets;

from the shanties creaking iron-sheets<br/>
violence like a bug-infested rag is tossed<br/>
and fear is imminent as sound in the wind-swung bell;

the long dayâ€™s anger pants from sand and rocks;<br/>
but for this breathing night at least,<br/>
my land, my love, sleep well.
