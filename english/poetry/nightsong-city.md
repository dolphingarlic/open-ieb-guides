# *Nightsong: City* - Dennis Brutus (1924-2009)

[Return to poetry](/english/poetry)

Sleep well, my love sleep well:<br/>
the harbor lights glaze over restless docks,<br/>
police cars cockroach through the tunnel streets;

from the shanties creaking iron-sheets<br/>
violence like a bug-infested rag is tossed<br/>
and fear is imminent as sound in the wind-swung bell;

the long dayâ€™s anger pants from sand and rocks;<br/>
but for this breathing night at least,<br/>
my land, my love, sleep well.

## Analysis

### Message and Themes

**TL;DR: Apartheid-era South Africa has many problems (like racism and violence), but the speaker wants his "land" and "love" to forget about it for one night and sleep well.**

#### Structure

The poem is structured like a lullaby - there is some rhyme across stanzas and the speaker tells his "love" to "sleep well".

This structure contrasts the content of the poem and makes it euphemistic. The contrast shows that the speaker hopes for tenderness amidst the violent reality.

#### Stanza 1

In this stanza, the speaker tells his "love" to sleep well. We are never told explicitly who this "love" is, but we presume that it is either South Africa or Brutus' former white lover, from whom he was separated due to Apartheid laws.

"Police cars" are compared to "cockroaches", which implies that they literally infest the streets and make life difficult for black South Africans.

The presence of police cars also implies that there is a lot of crime in the shanty towns.

Additionally, "docks" are described as "restless" and "streets" are described as "tunnel\[s\]", which evoke an eerie mood despite the gentle tone.

#### Stanza 2

In this stanza, the eerie mood becomes much more sinister. This stanza is the climax of the poem.

The speaker speaks about "creaking iron sheets" and "sound in the wind-swung bell". These were both sounds one could hear in Apartheid-era South Africa at night.

Just like the police sirens from the police cars in the previous stanza, these sounds would've evoked fear in black South Africans at the time. People lived in the "shanties" in constant discontent and fear.

There is also a lot of "violence", as it is "tossed like a bug-infested rag", which implies that it is tossed frequently and carelessly.

#### Stanza 3

In this stanza, the "action" from the previous stanzas die down and the phrase "sleep well" is repeated.

"The long day's anger" is a metaphor for Apartheid as a whole. South Africa is so affected that the pain and anguish exude from not only the people, but from the "sand and rocks" as well.

### The Title

"Nightsong" refers to the many references to sounds heard in the city in this poem. These sounds make a "song" when sounding together. Additionally, it refers to the structure of the poem being a lullaby, which is literally a night song.
