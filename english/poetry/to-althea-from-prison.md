# *To Althea, from Prison* - Richard Lovelace (1618-1658)

[Back to poetry](/english/poetry)

When Love with unconfinèd wings<br/>
Hovers within my Gates,<br/>
And my divine Althea brings<br/>
To whisper at the Grates;<br/>
When I lie tangled in her hair,<br/>
And fettered to her eye,<br/>
The Gods that wanton in the Air,<br/>
Know no such Liberty.

When flowing Cups run swiftly round<br/>
With no allaying Thames,<br/>
Our careless heads with Roses bound,<br/>
Our hearts with Loyal Flames;<br/>
When thirsty grief in Wine we steep,<br/>
When Healths and draughts go free,<br/>
Fishes that tipple in the Deep<br/>
Know no such Liberty.

When (like committed linnets) I<br/>
With shriller throat shall sing<br/>
The sweetness, Mercy, Majesty,<br/>
And glories of my King;<br/>
When I shall voice aloud how good<br/>
He is, how Great should be,<br/>
Enlargèd Winds, that curl the Flood,<br/>
Know no such Liberty.

Stone Walls do not a Prison make,<br/>
Nor Iron bars a Cage;<br/>
Minds innocent and quiet take<br/>
That for an Hermitage.<br/>
If I have freedom in my Love,<br/>
And in my soul am free,<br/>
Angels alone that soar above,<br/>
Enjoy such Liberty.

## Analysis

### Message and Themes

**TL;DR: The speaker is physically imprisoned, but he assures his lover (Althea) that nothing can imprison his mind, his love for her, or his love for his king.**

#### Stanza 1

In this stanza, the speaker uses flowery language like "unconfinéd wings" and "divine" to describe Althea and his love for her. This shows his love for her and it creates a **reassuring** tone, which is maintained for the rest of the poem.

Notice how in lines 5 and 6, the speaker is trapped by Althea with chains made of hair (he's "fetter'd to her eye"), but since he loves her, the gods that fly freely around in the sky "know no such liberty". This implies that nothing can confine love for him.

#### Stanza 2

In this stanza, the speaker talks about the freedom from before his imprisonment. He and his friends would drink wine and praise their king, which gave them freedom in the form of ideas and joy. Nothing diluted the wine they drank and they drank freely and carelessly.

Even though he is currently imprisoned, he remembers those moments and that gives him some freedom as well.

#### Stanza 3

In this stanza, the speaker talks about the freedom he gets when he sings "the sweetest, mercy, majesty and glories of [his] King".

He can still do this while in prison, so it reinforces the theme that ideas can't be confined.

#### Stanza 4

In this stanza, the speaker suggests that if one is imprisoned only physically, they may as well not be imprisoned at all because they are still free in thought and love. This is seen in the famous first sentence of the stanza: "Stone walls do not a prison make, Nor iron bars a cage".

In fact, the speaker argues that physical imprisonment is merely an opportunity for mental reflection and the development of more ideas, hence it gives him more freedom.

All this is to reassure Althea that he is actually quite happy in prison.

## Historical Background

Lovelace wrote this poem in 1642 while imprisoned in Gatehouse Prison. That year, Richard Lovelace presented a petition to the British parliament that protested the Bishops Exclusion Bill. The bill prevented those heavily involved with the Churches of England from enacting any temporal control. Lovelace, on the other hand, protested that the role of Anglican Bishops that were excluded should be restored in Parliament.

Althea's identity is unknown and some doubt that she even existed at all. However, evidence suggests she was a woman named Lucy Sacheverell.

Both of these poems talk about love and imprisonment.

### [*Touch* - Hugh Lewin (1939-2018)](touch)

Both of these poems are about physical imprisonment, but both the reactions and the circumstances of the speakers differ greatly. How would Lewin react to Lovelace's poem?
