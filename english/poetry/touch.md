# *Touch* - Hugh Lewin (1939-2018)

When I get out<br/>
I’m going to ask someone<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to touch me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very gently please<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and slowly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touch me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to learn again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how life feels.

I’ve not been touched<br/>
for seven years<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for seven years<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve been untouched<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of touch<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I’ve learnt<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the meaning of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untouchable.

Untouched – not quite<br/>
I can count the things<br/>
that have touched me

One: fists<br/>
At the beginning<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce mad fists<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beating beating<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till I remember<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;screaming<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t touch me<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;please don’t touch me.

Two: paws<br/>
The first four years of paws<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patting paws, searching<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– arms up, shoes off<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legs apart –<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prodding paws, systematic<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavy, indifferent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probing away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all privacy.

I don’t want fists and paws<br/>
I want<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to want to be touched<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to touch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to feel alive<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I get out<br/>
Here I am<br/>
please touch me.

## Analysis

### Message and Themes

**TL;DR: The speaker was dehumanised in prison and would now like to experience gentle human contact for once in 7 years.**

#### Stanza 1

In this stanza, the speaker presents us with a simple request: he would like to be touched "very gently please" when he "get[s] out" of jail. **He wants to feel warmth and kindness, and he "want[s] to learn again how life feels."**

This suggests that prison was lifeless and that he wasn't touched **gently** during his time in prison (i.e. he was dehumanised).

#### Stanza 2

In this stanza, the speaker cleverly explores all the different meanings of what it means to be touched.

Firstly, he has "not been touched for seven years". This refers to physical touch.

Secondly, he has "been untouched". This implies that he has not felt human kindness.

Thirdly, he has been "out of touch". This implies that he has not had any contact with the outside world for a long time.

Lastly, he has become "untouchable". This refers to the caste system in India, where "untouchables" are the lowest caste, and it implies that he has been dehumanised (possibly by the prison guards).

#### Stanza 3

In this stanza, the speaker simply clarifies that he has been touched physically, **but the experiences were all unpleasant and not what he wants**.

This sets up the list of ways he has been unpleasantly touched in the following stanzas.

#### Stanza 4

In this stanza, the speaker explains how he was treated violently in prison.

"Fierce mad fists" beat him until he begged for mercy. The speaker did not want to be touched this way.

The phrase "fierce mad fists" have strong connotations of violence.

#### Stanza 5

In this stanza, the speaker explains how his privacy was intruded and how his dignity was removed.

"Every day", "patting paws" would search for contraband on his body. They were "heavy" and "indifferent" - not the loving touch that he wants.

"Paws" refers to dogs' paws and how they dig around. This represents an intrusion of privacy.

The dashes in this stanza act as parentheses that enclose the commands the guards gave the speaker in prison.

#### Stanza 6

In this stanza, the speaker refers back to the first stanza and repeats what he wants. This time though, he **"want[s] to want to be touched"**.

The difference here is that he doesn't want to fear touch anymore like how he did in prison.

He was so dehumanised that he can't say that he simply "want[s] to be touched" anymore.

### [*To Althea, from Prison* - Richard Lovelace (1618-1658)](to-althea-from-prison)

Both of these poems are about physical imprisonment, but both the reactions and the circumstances of the speakers differ greatly. How would Lewin react to Lovelace's poem?
