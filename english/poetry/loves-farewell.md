# *Love's Farewell* - Michael Drayton (1563-1631)

[Return to poetry](/english/poetry)

Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,-<br/>
Nay I have done, you get no more of me;<br/>
And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,<br/>
That thus so cleanly I myself can free;

Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,<br/>
And when we meet at any time again,<br/>
Be it not seen in either of our brows<br/>
That we one jot of former love retain.

Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,<br/>
When his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,<br/>
When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,<br/>
And innocence is closing up his eyes,

-Now if thou would'st, when all have given him over,<br/>
From death to life thou might'st him yet decover!

## Analysis

This poem is a **Shakespearian sonnet**. Just like many other sonnets, this poem talks about love and breaking up.

### Message and Themes

**TL;DR: The speaker initially acts like it's a good thing that their relationship is over, but then breaks down and begs to get back together.**

### Stanza 1

In this stanza, the tone is **determined and clinical**. The speaker speaks about how there's "no help" in saving their failing relationship. He also speaks about how he "can free" himself from the relationship, which suggests that the relationship confined him.

Although the tone is clinical, the descriptive phrases like "glad with all my heart" and "you get no more of me" hint that the speaker is a bit **melodramatic**. This is the first hint that **he doesn't actually want the relationship to end**.

The phrase "glad with all my heart" is ironic because as we see in the rhyming couplet, he is actually very sad about their relationship possibly ending.

The dash at the end of the first line simply introduces a list of reasons of why they must "kiss and part".

### Stanza 2

In this stanza, the speaker lists instructions on how not to show that they "one jot of former love retain". This cold, clinical listing reinforces the clinical tone from the previous stanza.

However, we see once again that the speaker is being melodramatic - one can't possibly expect them to "shake hands forever" and "cancel all [their] vows". This suggests that the speaker is frustrated and possibly being sarcastic. **The speaker is emphatic about their relationship ending**.

### Stanza 3

In this stanza, the tone suddenly changes and becomes **sympathetic**. Here, the speaker compares love to a dying person. "Passion", "faith", and "innocence" are also personified.

These examples of personification are effective because it shows that the speaker cares deeply about their relationship ending, just like how one would care deeply about a loved one dying. This contradicts his previous apathy.

### Rhyming Couplet

The rhyming couplet starts with a dash, which indicates an abrupt change in thought. Here, the speaker suddenly asks his (former) lover to get back together in a relationship despite past differences.

The exclamation mark at the end of this stanza shows the speaker's hope and passion.

## Historical background

Michael Drayton was born in Warwickshire (England) in 1563. As a youth, he became a page to a certain Sir Henry Goodeere, who saw to his education.

The poet fell in love with Sir Henry's daughter, Anne, the inspiration behind the poem "Idea" but he clearly did not win her love as he died a bachelor.

Drayton settled in London in 1590 where he enjoyed a long career as a poet, with his first published work appearing in 1591.

He was a favourite at the court of Queen Elizabeth but he was not successful in winning the favour of her successor, King James I. A poem which he wrote complimenting the new king was ridiculed and his service at the court was rejected.

Drayton died in London in December, 1631. He was buried in Westminster Abbey under a monument with an epitaph by Ben Johnson, a famous English playwright and one of Drayton's friends.
